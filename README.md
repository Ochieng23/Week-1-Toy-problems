3 Projects in One. Students Grader, Speed Detector,and Net Salary Calculator.
CHALLENGE 1 - Students Grader

The input should be between 0 and 100.

The output then corresponds to the correct grade based on set conditions
   A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.
   
CHALLENGE 2 - Speed Detector
This program takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. And if the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”.

Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
